# BGP Zero-Touch with Scrapli Asyncio
 
Scrapli has the capability to support asynchronous-based programming in Python, also known as Python AsyncIO, by offering alternative async drivers and functions that enable the creation of Scrapli AsyncIO-based scripts.

With the help of the Scrapli library's asynchronous-based programming support, we can achieve zero-touch installation of hundreds of routers simultaneously with this line of code. This allows us to set up multiple routers at the same time without any manual intervention.
